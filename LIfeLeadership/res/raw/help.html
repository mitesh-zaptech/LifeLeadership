                Welcome to the Rascal Radio Help page, the place to come to become an expert in Rascal Radio-ology! Rascal Radio gives you complete control of what you
                want to listen to. It allows to you to create and save your own stations based on speaker and subject matter or simply play the radio in shuffle mode,
                which randomly plays audios from the entire database of life-changing information. Below are a few helpful hints.

                <strong>How to Create a Station</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>If you’d like to create a particular speaker or subject station, press the Select a Speaker or Select a Subject button, select the desired speaker or subject, close the menu, then press Play.  If you wish to play selections for both a particular speaker and a particular subject, make selections from both the Speaker and Subject menus individually before pressing Play.

                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>How to Save a Station</strong>
            </p>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>To save a Station, simply press the My Stations icon while listening to the Station. The My Stations icon is the Heart shaped icon and will contain a
                    "+" if the Station is not currently saved. After saving a Station, the Station will show up in the menu under My Stations. You can also remove a saved
                    Station when listening to that particular Station by pressing the My Stations icon again (which will display a heart with a "-").
